    "intent": "Developed a simple browser game that provides addictive gameplay within 30 seconds, aiming to maximize session time and improve repeat rate. Deliver comfortable play experience across all devices to reduce bounce rate, while balancing monetization and UX through user behavior analysis and non-intrusive ad placement",

Main menu now allows selection between two games",
    "intent": "Current Analytics data (25% bounce rate, 650 seconds session time) is good, but PV and session counts are low. Increasing game variety to maximize repeat rate and total play time.

    "intent": "Currently, Infinity Drop only has coin earning and combo systems, which have limitations for maintaining motivation during long play sessions. By introducing the skill shop, we create a game loop of 'earn coins→buy skills→challenge scores with new skills' to significantly increase session time and replay rate. Each skill has different properties, giving players new strategies and goals, maximizing game immersion and long-tail engagement",

    "intent": "Based on Analytics data (273 seconds session time, 36.4% bounce rate), session time is good but Neon Dash, the newest of the 3 games, lacked smartphone touch controls. Since ~70% of mobile users expect swipe gestures, this is essential to reduce bounce rate and extend session time.
