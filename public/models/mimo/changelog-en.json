    "intent": "Developed a simple browser game that provides addictive gameplay within 30 seconds, aiming to maximize session time and improve repeat rate. Deliver comfortable play experience across all devices to reduce bounce rate, while balancing monetization and UX through user behavior analysis and non-intrusive ad placement",

Features 4x4/5x5 grid support, 3 difficulty levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced), 4-direction swipe/keyboard controls, high score recording, victory screen upon reaching 2048, and haptic & sound feedback. Main menu now allows selection between two games",
    "intent": "Current Analytics data (25% bounce rate, 650 seconds session time) is good, but PV and session counts are low. Increasing game variety to maximize repeat rate and total play time. Offering different gameplay (gravity-free slide puzzle) from existing Infinity Drop to attract different types of users and encourage long-term engagement and repeat visits",
